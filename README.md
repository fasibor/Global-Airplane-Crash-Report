![Global Airplane Crash Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb9deb14-e540-4a5f-b695-bcd0ba2e1f90)


## Overview  
This analysis examines global airplane crash data from 1918 to 2022, focusing on identifying the primary causes of crashes, regional trends, flight phases most at risk, and commonly involved aircraft types. By leveraging historical aviation incident data, the goal is to uncover actionable insights that inform safety improvements, enhance pilot training, and support policy-making efforts aimed at reducing crash incidents worldwide.

**What the Dashboard Says**  
The *Global Airplane Crash Dashboard 2022* consolidates key metrics, including total crashes (28.53K), total fatalities (157K), and regional distributions. It serves as a comprehensive tool to identify safety challenges and guide improvements based on historical data analysis. Built with Power BI, the dashboard introduces interactive visualizations that enhance data exploration and insight generation for aviation stakeholders.


## Why This Project is Useful  
This project provides valuable insights for aviation authorities, airline operators, aircraft manufacturers, and safety regulators by leveraging over a century of historical crash data. Key benefits include:

- **Targeted Safety Improvements** – Identifies leading causes of crashes across flight phases to guide training, aircraft design, and operational protocols.  
- **Regional Risk Assessment** – Highlights geographic regions with higher incident rates, helping allocate safety resources and tailor policy interventions.  
- **Aircraft & Flight Phase Trends** – Tracks which aircraft types and flight stages (e.g., takeoff, landing) are most vulnerable, informing engineering enhancements and pilot preparedness.  
- **Regulatory & Policy Strategy** – Offers data-driven recommendations to aviation agencies for updating international safety standards and enforcement practices.


## How to Get Started  
To explore this analysis:

- **Download the Dataset** – Access airplane crash data from reputable sources:  
  - [BAAA Crash Archives](https://www.baaa-acro.com/index.php/crash-archives)  
  - [Kaggle: Historical Plane Crash Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abeperez/historical-plane-crash-data)  
- **Use Data Visualization Tools** – Analyze the data using Excel, Power BI, Tableau, or Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for advanced data exploration.  
- **Analyze Key Metrics** –  
  - Examine **regional crash trends** to identify high-risk areas and their contributing factors.  
  - Investigate **primary crash causes** (e.g., pilot error, mechanical failure, weather conditions).  
  - Assess **flight phase risks**, such as takeoff, cruising, or landing stages.  
  - Explore **aircraft type involvement** to detect models or manufacturers frequently linked to incidents.



## Key Findings  
1. The USA leads with 6,601 crashes, followed by the UK (2,388) and Russia (1,503). This reflects high air traffic and operational complexities in these regions, necessitating focused safety interventions.
   
3. Human error (3,919 in North America) and technical failures (4,718 in North America) dominate, followed by weather (515 cases). North America and Europe face elevated risks due to diverse contributing factors.
   
5. The deadliest phases are cruising (66,984 crashes), landing/descent (36,343), and take-off/climb (34,634), highlighting in-flight and approach risks. Enhanced monitoring during these phases is critical to reducing crash rates.
   
7. The Douglas C-47 recorded the highest total survivors (2,171), while the PZL-MIELEC AN-2 had the best survival rate (ratio of survivors to fatalities). The Boeing 737-200 and Douglas C-47 stand out for high fatality counts (3,004 passengers + 247 crew and over 12,000 total, respectively), indicating design or maintenance challenges.


## Recommendations  
1. **Human Error Mitigation**  
   Expand CRM and fatigue training to reduce human errors (3,919 cases in North America). Annual mental health evaluations will address fatigue risks.  

2. **Weather Risk Reduction**  
   Invest in AI-driven weather prediction tools for the 515 weather-related crashes in North America. Mandate real-time data sharing with flight crews.  

3. **High-Risk Aircraft Phase-out**  
   Audit and accelerate fleet modernisation for the Boeing 737-200 and Douglas C-47, incentivising retirement or retrofitting to reduce fatality tolls.  

4. **Regulatory Overhaul for High-Risk Regions**  
   Enforce stricter oversight in the USA, UK, Russia, and Canada through mandatory safety audits and maintenance protocols for ageing fleets.  

5. **Standardized Operational Protocols**  
   Adopt uniform preventive maintenance checklists and crew assessments globally, with penalties for non-compliance, especially for military flights (4,647 crashes).  

6. **Model-Specific Safety Interventions**  
   Conduct targeted airworthiness reviews for the Boeing 737-200, mandating retrofits or restrictions until safety improves.  

7. **Maintenance Systems**  
   Promote IoT and AI-based maintenance to tackle technical failures (4,718 cases in North America), focusing on older aircraft.  

8. **Security Enhancement**  
   Deploy AI cargo screening and hardened cockpits in Europe to counter security incidents (429 cases).  

9. **Seasonal Safety Drills**  
   Conduct pre-season drills before summer months to mitigate weather-related risks, enhancing crew preparedness.  

10. **Operator Audits**  
    Require operators with recurring incidents to undergo training programmes and audits to ensure consistent safety practices.



## Final Thoughts  
Aviation remains one of the safest modes of transport, but continuous improvement is non-negotiable. By embracing historical crash data and transforming it into actionable strategies, stakeholders can mitigate risks, modernize systems, and strengthen global aviation standards. The insights from this project not only help prevent future tragedies but also promote a culture of transparency, innovation, and accountability in the aviation ecosystem.
